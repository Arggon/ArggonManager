# tools.arggon.start --worktree skips the claim commit in a fresh worktree (no install prepared)

## Notes

### 2026-09-22 @ses_f34ba048bffeDqO6XhG0C62Nw6
## Context

Reported by the `task-ui-shared-viewmodel` worker during wave 0 (finding F0):

```
tools.arggon.start({ id, assignee: "Arggon", worktree: true, push: true })
```

created the worktree/branch and pushed, but the claim commit was **skipped** because the fresh worktree had no `node_modules`: the wired pre-commit gate (`npm run --silent arggon -- validate`) failed with `sh: tsx: command not found`. The worker ran `npm ci` and committed the claim manually (`46039d1f`), then continued. The worktree path is `../ArggonManager-task-ui-shared-viewmodel`.

The CLI path (`arggon start --worktree`) prepares the worktree's install before the claim commit (link farm, `linkedNodeModules` in `--json`, `bug-start-worktree-node-modules`); this native-tool run did not leave the worktree able to run the gate, and the failure was silent in the tool result (the claim commit was simply absent).

## Acceptance

- [ ] Reproduce on a fresh worktree through the native tool: either the claim commit runs the pre-commit gate without a manual `npm ci` (install prepared like the CLI), or the result reports the skipped claim commit plus the remediation explicitly
- [ ] Decide and document the native path's install contract in `ArggonManager/docs/agents.md` §Orchestration and the OpenCode playbook (what `tools.arggon.start` guarantees about the worktree install)
- [ ] Regression coverage for the native path (unit or smoke scenario) — a fresh worktree must not silently lose its claim commit
- [ ] `npm test`, `npm run check:plugin`, `arggon validate` green on the fix
