# Orchestration — multi-agent work

Part of the `arggon-cli` skill (`SKILL.md`). Non-trivial items are **orchestrated
by default**: the delivery lead delegates them to subagents instead of working
them inline. Trivial items (one-line fixes, doc tweaks) stay inline. Full rules:
`ArggonManager/docs/agents.md` §Orchestration.

## The roles (named by what they decide)

Authoritative table, with the software analogue marked non-normative:
`ArggonManager/docs/engineering.md` §Roles and authority (ADR 0021 §6.1).

| Shipped id                  | Role                 | Decides                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arggon-delivery-lead`      | Delivery lead        | what is built next and in what order; who is dispatched; tracker state; merge verification and the `done` flip |
| `arggon-standards-reviewer` | Practice & standards | whether a change is right by the project's own bar; asks for refactor                                          |
| `arggon-maker`              | Maker                | producing the change, keeping it on the item                                                                   |
| `arggon-verifier`           | Verifier             | whether the delivered thing does what was specified, by executing the project's gates                          |

Two boundaries the roles must not blur: the delivery lead **sequences** and
recommends priority — the product owner (human) sets the `priority` field; and
the verifier **reports** observed-versus-expected without deciding the verdict.
Each id names its **role** (ADR 0021 §6.2a′) — never the software title, never
the process verb — so cite the role, which is what the table above states.

Everywhere else the loop is **parity**: any human and any agent may claim, work,
review, comment and merge under the same kernel rules and the same JSON
contracts. Only the irreversible overrides are structurally human-only — steal,
waive, force, reopen — and they are the product owner's (ADR 0021 §1/§2).

## Delivery lead duties

- **Wave planning by file-disjointness:** group claimable items into waves whose
  members touch disjoint files/modules; items that would collide go in different
  waves.
- **Claim before dispatch:** claim every item you are about to delegate —
  `tools.arggon.start({ id, assignee: "arggon-delivery-lead", worktree: true })`
  (CLI: `arggon start <id> --worktree`) — **before** launching its maker, then
  launch into the path the claim returned. `assignee` is **your role id**, never
  the product owner's login: a claim identifies its writer, and the writer is not
  the owner (`@me` resolves the human login, so an agent claim correctly does not
  appear under `--assignee @me`). That call is the worktree step: it takes the
  single-writer stamp, creates `../<repo>-<id>`, pre-builds the packages that copy
  owns and records `branch` + `worktree_path`. Never hand-roll `git worktree add`
  for a claim, never dispatch a maker as the first claimant, never claim an item
  you are not dispatching (unclaim it **and release it** —
  `tools.arggon.cleanup({ release: id })` / `arggon cleanup --release <id>`: the
  unclaim clears the assignee but leaves the claim's worktree, `.arggon.env` and
  claim stamp behind, and `--prune` cannot reap a `todo` item; the unclaim's own
  `claimFootprint` receipt names the release command), and read a start **refusal**
  as evidence,
  not a retry — `start` has no `--force`, and no refusal is a licence to route
  around it by hand.
- **Per-item worktrees:** one maker per item, each in its own worktree — the
  recorded `worktree_path` on the item, never a `../<repo>-<id>` convention
  guess; no two makers share a working tree.
- **Code review (practice & standards):** review **every** subagent PR before merge
  against the bar the **project's engineering docs declare** (this project's
  `ArggonManager/docs/engineering.md` §Review bar: architecture-first,
  conventions first, quality/security bar, evidence travels with the change, docs
  travel with code, scope stays on the item, **blocking end-to-end check** — whose
  software worked example is the probe evidence and the browser drive the review
  bar describes) plus the
  coordination specifics: surgical staging, no cross-item files, no unrelated
  reformatting, acceptance ticks honest. Change requests and verdicts go back via
  `arggon comment <item-id>` on the item — never as GitHub PR comments.
- **Merge verification:** after each maker's change, verify the merge; resolve
  cross-item conflicts when waves overlap.
- **Tracker ownership:** claim conflicts, blocked items, follow-up filing, and
  final wave verification (`arggon validate` ok, `arggon doctor` clean).
- **Sequencing ≠ priority:** decide what is built next and in what order, and
  recommend `priority` changes — the product owner sets the field (ADR 0021 §6.1).

## Subagent rules

- Work an item inside the worktree you were handed, and only when the item is
  **already claimed** — a delivery lead that dispatches work claims it first, so
  confirm with `tools.arggon.show({ id, meta: true })` and never re-claim, never
  take over the stamp and never hand-roll a worktree. Claim it through `start`
  (never a bare `update --status in_progress`) only when you picked the item up
  yourself and no claim exists — stamping your own role id, never a human login.
- Never flip your item `done` — completion is the delivery lead's call after merge
  verification — and never reopen `done`/`cancelled` or steal a claim. Those
  irreversible overrides are the product owner's, structurally.
- Expect the delivery lead's code review on your change and address change
  requests before it merges.
- Come with evidence for behavior changes: **the gates this project declares**,
  executed end-to-end against the specification and reported as
  expected-vs-observed (in software: changed commands probed on a fixture, UI
  changes browser-driven per ADR 0008) — the smoke gate blocks merge.
- Keep the item's acceptance checklist honest: it is the **done contract** and
  the domain-invariant — a non-software project checks it with its own gates, a
  software project with tests, lint and a smoke.
- Report findings back to the delivery lead instead of filing tracker items — the
  delivery lead consolidates and files.

## Worktrees in practice

`arggon start <id> --worktree` claims, creates (or attaches to) the worktree at
`../<repo-name>-<id>`, runs the claim commit/push inside it, and records
`worktree_path` on the item. Start prepares the worktree first — it mirrors the
primary checkout's `node_modules` as a per-worktree link farm when the worktree
lacks an install, so the repo's pre-commit gate can run (start never commits the
install; it is removed before a configured `x-worktree.post-start` hook runs, so
`npm ci` cannot reify through it and empty the primary install) — and a failure
after creation keeps the worktree and branch instead of deleting them (the error
names the failing step, path and remediation; re-running attaches). The workspace
packages the worktree also carries (`node_modules/@arggondev/lib -> ../../lib`) are
pointed at the worktree copy and pre-built with the package's own `build` script
before the claim commit when their declared entry is missing, so the spawned
CLI/tests run the branch's build; a copy that could not be built keeps the
primary's copy and is named by `linkedWorkspaces` in `--json` (re-read after the
hook). A worktree that must use a full local install can run `npm ci` (e.g. via
`x-worktree.post-start: npm ci`). Move the session into that path
(`session_move` in OpenCode V2) so every later command runs there. When the work
is merged, `arggon cleanup` lists stale worktrees and `--prune` removes them.

The claim, branch, PR and validate rules apply to subagents **unchanged**: same
commands, same gates, same never-list. The kernel enforces the rules; neither
role forks them.

One goal per claimed item: `arggon goal <id>` (rendered from inside the item's
worktree) turns the item's acceptance checklist into the goal-mode contract an
agent loop runs on — objective, verification, boundaries — and takes "is there
work left" from the DONE GATE, so it never contradicts what `done` would refuse.
It refuses an unresolvable identity, a foreign claim, a closed item and any
checkout that is not the item's recorded `worktree_path` (no override flag), and
a goal never spans worktrees or items.
